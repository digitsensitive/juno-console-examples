# Juno
Juno is a clean and lightweight 2D game framework written in TypeScript for
making HTML5 Games.

The structure of Juno is similar to that of fantasy consoles and in the future
Juno might become a kind of fantasy console.

The framework is still in a very early stage of development.

## Getting started

### Installation

```sh
npm install juno-console --save
yarn add juno-console
bower install juno-console --save
```

[official Juno examples](https://github.com/digitsensitive/juno-console-examples).

A total of 16 colors can be used. Since a string length of 6 is
required per color, the whole string is 96 characters long.
